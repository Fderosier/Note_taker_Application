# Note_taker_Application
Description


This repository hosts a JavaScript-based note-taking application designed to run on Node.js. The project makes use of several npm packages, including express, uniqid, and fs.

Upon launch, the application presents a homepage interface where users can initiate note-taking activities. Upon navigation, the interface splits into two columns: on the left, existing notes are listed, while the right-hand side provides blank fields for users to input new notes. Users can easily access past notes by selecting them from the list on the left, discard new note entries without saving, or save new notes. Additionally, users have the option to delete notes from the saved list.

Installation

Install the necessary npm packages for this app by running npm install in your terminal.

Usage

Credits

I consulted the Node.js documentation on file systems to guide me in implementing the DELETE request functionality for this project. Additionally, I drew inspiration from the UNH Bootcamp repository's Express activities "18_Stu_POST-Fetch" and "22_Stu_Modular-Routing" when structuring files and determining the coding framework for this project.
